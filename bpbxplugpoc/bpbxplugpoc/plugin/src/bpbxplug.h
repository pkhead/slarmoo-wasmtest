/*
emscripten compilation command:
    emcc plugin.c --no-entry -sSTANDALONE_WASM -sEXPORTED_FUNCTIONS=_bpbxplug_entry,_malloc,_free

and suggested flags:
    -sMALLOC=emmalloc               typical memory allocation usage should be
                                    low, so emscripten recommends using this.
    -sINITIAL_HEAP=...              emscripten's default is 16 MiB of memory,
                                    which for typical use case is probably a bit
                                    too much. here are some values you can
                                    set this to:

                                    524288  = 0.5 MiB
                                    1048576 = 1 MiB
                                    2097152 = 2 MiB
                                    4194304 = 4 MiB
                                    8388608 = 8 MiB

                                    1 MiB is a good choice for typical use case.
                                    If you have a delay line or store some other
                                    sort of internal audio buffer, you may want
                                    to use a larger value.

each module is required to export the following symbols:
    compiler exports:
        memory:                     Exported memory object.
        __indirect_function_table: 	A table which is used to resolve function
                                    "pointers" to the actual function.
    
    these symbols are not part of the plugin api, but are required for the
    module to export:
        malloc:                     Function to dynamically allocate memory
                                    within the module. Takes one unsigned
                                    32-bit integer as a parameter, which
                                    represents the size of the desired
                                    allocation, and then returns a
                                    pointer to the newly allocated portion
                                    of memory. If this fails, it should return
                                    a null pointer.
        free:                       Frees a previously dynamically allocated
                                    portion of memory. Takes one unsigned
                                    32-bit integer as a parameter, which is the
                                    base pointer of the memory allocation, and
                                    returns no values. If the given parameter is
                                    a null pointer, it should do nothing.
    
    the rest are functions for the plugin api:
        const bpbxplug_module_s* bpbxplug_entry(void)
            Entry point for the module.
